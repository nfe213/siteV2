# siteV2
This is my website.

It was built in conjunction with my [WebKit](https://github.com/nfe213/Webkit) repo, which has HTML/CSS code blocks for some of the redundant elements on this page.

The code in both repositories is public, take as little or as much as you'd like; I just do this for fun.
